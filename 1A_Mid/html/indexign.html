            <h2>Historical Information</h2>
            <p>The Lighthouse was located on the small island of Pharos, at the entrance to the harbor of the ancient city of Alexandria, Egypt. Pharos was a small island located on the western edge of the Nile Delta. In 332 BC, Alexander the Great founded the city of Alexandria as a cultural and commercial center.</p>
            <p>The lighthouse was built in the 3rd century BC. After Alexander the Great died of a fever at the age of 32, the first Ptolemy declared himself king in 305 BC and commissioned its construction shortly after.</p>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The building was completed during the reign of his son, the second Ptolemy. The Lighthouse of Alexandria was one of the greatest engineering feats of antiquity. This lighthouse not only served as a guide for sailors, but it also became a symbol of innovation and the power of the Hellenistic civilization. It represented human capacity to overcome challenges and create impressive structures that would stand the test of time.</p>

                <p>The lighthouse served to show sailors the safe way to the city's harbor, and it is a symbol of ancient engineering and architecture, with its influence seen in many modern lighthouses around the world. For centuries, the lighthouse was admired by travelers and became a legend, inspiring tales and stories about its bright light and monumental height.</p>

                <h3>Curiosities</h3>
                <p>The Tower of Alexandria, or Lighthouse of Alexandria, is an iconic landmark of Hellenistic architecture, standing out for its advanced functionality.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <ul>
                        <li>For many centuries, the Lighthouse of Alexandria was one of the tallest structures in the world. Damaged by three earthquakes between 956 and 1323, it became an abandoned ruin. Even in ruins, the lighthouse remained an important landmark and a symbol of the ancient glory of Alexandria.</li>
                        <li>Until 1480, it was the third surviving ancient wonder, when the last of its remaining stones was used to build a fort, a building that still stands today in place of the Lighthouse of Alexandria. This fort is a tangible reminder of the lighthouse's grandeur and its historical significance.</li>
                        <li>In 1994, archaeological remains comprising stone blocks and statues from the lighthouse were found by a team of diver archaeologists. These discoveries helped to better understand the construction and appearance of the lighthouse, providing a clearer vision of its magnificence.</li>
                        <li>Roman coins found in the Alexandrian monastery show that a statue of a Triton stood at each of the four corners of the building, along with a statue of Poseidon or Zeus on top of the lighthouse. These sculptures not only adorned the lighthouse but also symbolized divine protection for sailors approaching Alexandria.</li>

                <h4>Architecture</h4>
                <p>The Lighthouse was about 150 meters tall, established on a square base, which was topped by an octagonal marble tower.</p>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Above this tower was the essential element for the lighthouse, a flame that was constantly lit. The masonry blocks of Pharos were interconnected, sealed with molten lead, to withstand the sea waves. These features made the Lighthouse of Alexandria not only a luminous guide but also an impressive feat of engineering and architecture. The construction of the lighthouse required a large amount of resources and labor, reflecting the importance that the city of Alexandria had in antiquity as a center of trade and knowledge.</p>
